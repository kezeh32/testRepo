## Energy Delivered Among Distribution Companies in Nigeria (2014-2021)


This analysis relies heavily on **Pandas** and **Numpy** Libraries.
Dataset used is got from **NERC** (Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission) but downloaded onto a *csv* format. <p> There are a total of 11 distribution companies in Nigeria. And data represented here shows energy consumed/delivered in Gigawatt-hours (GWh)</p> <br>*Note that original data would be wrangled in order to give a more desirable analysis*</br>
